# When cloning the myrepos-config repo using vcsh, the pre-upgrade script that
# myrepos-config provides isn't available until after the pre-upgrade hooks
# have been called.  So, this script calls the pre-upgrade script after
# myrepos-config has been cloned.  This is essentially the same as calling
# 'vcsh update' after the initial clone, but does it automatically.
